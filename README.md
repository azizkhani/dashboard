# Dashboard

This is a simple smart mirror built from:

1. An Android phone, [Nexus 5X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5X).

2. A weather/time webpage, [index.html](https://pr.gg/dashboard).

3. An app to show the webpage, [app/Dashboard](app/Dashboard).

4. A acryllic 2-way mirror from [TAP plastics](http://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/two_way_mirrored_acrylic/558). (30cm*60cm out of the surplus bin, $30)

5. Black [construction paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00563PXHQ), taped behind the mirror for an even background.
